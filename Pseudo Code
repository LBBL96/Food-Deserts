The USDA defines what's considered a food desert and which areas will be helped by this initiative:
	To qualify as a “low-access community,” at least 500 people and/or at least 33 percent of the census tract's
	population must reside more than one mile from a supermarket or large grocery store (for rural census tracts,
	the distance is more than 10 miles).

classify location with [Urban, Suburban, Rural]

Add column on dataframe ["food deserted"]
seperate all rows in location groups
iterate over each row with 
	elif row == Urban then
		if distfromfood>1
		then row["food deserted"]="True"
		else Pass
	elif row == Suburban then
		if distfromfood>3
		then row["food deserted"]="True"
		else Pass
	else row == Rural then
		if distfromfood>10
		then row["food deserted"]="True"
		else Pass
