# Food Deserts in Three Texas Cities

## Team Members

## Project Description
A food desert is an area that lacks access to affordable and fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy items. We chose to study their occurrence in three urban areas: Austin, Dallas, and Laredo, Texas. We further restricted our study to low-income areas where residents are less likely to have access to transportation and therefore are more negatively affected by supermarket distance than residents of wealthier areas. 

## Research Questions
1) If you live in a neighborhood with a Title 1 school, how likely are you also to live in a food desert?
2) Is there a difference among the three cities in the proportion of food deserts?
3) Does the likelihood of living in a food desert increase as poverty increases?
4) What is the average distance a person in any given neighborhood must drive to get to the nearest grocery store?
5) Does driving distance correlate to the level of poverty in a neighborhood?
## Data Gathering
The demographic data we found mostly tended to be aggregated by zip code, which vary in size, making it difficult to get accurate information about the presence of food deserts at a neighborhood level. To study food deserts in smaller areas, we needed to find points to represent the centers of neighborhoods. We decided to use Title 1 elementary schools, which qualify for federal funding for low-income families. Not only do elementary schools tend to be in the center of neighborhoods, the federal government provides annual reports on the poverty level within Title 1 schools, which gave us the ability draw conclusions about the relationship between poverty level and food desert status. We pulled the 2018 list of Title 1 schools from the U.S. Department of Education to begin our study.

## Conclusions

## Suggestions for Further Study

Are there correlations between the racial and ethnic makeup of a given neighborhood and its food desert status?

What are the relative health outcomes
