# Food Deserts in Three Texas Cities

## Team Members
Lynn Leifker and Kellye Rennell

## Project Description
A food desert is an area that lacks access to affordable and fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy items. We chose to study their occurrence in three urban areas: Austin, Dallas, and Laredo, Texas. We further restricted our study to low-income areas where residents are less likely to have access to transportation and therefore are more negatively affected by supermarket distance than residents of wealthier areas. 

## Research Questions
1) If you live in a neighborhood with a Title 1 school, how likely are you also to live in a food desert?
2) Is there a difference among the three cities in the proportion of food deserts?
3) Does the likelihood of living in a food desert increase as poverty increases?
4) What is the average distance a person in any given neighborhood must drive to get to the nearest grocery store?
5) Does driving distance correlate to the level of poverty in a neighborhood?

## Conclusions

## Suggestions for Further Study

Are there correlations between the racial and ethnic makeup of a given neighborhood and its food desert status?

What are the relative health outcomes
