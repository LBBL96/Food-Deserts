# Food Deserts in Three Texas Cities

## Team Members
Lynn Leifker and Kellye Rennell

## Project Description
A food desert is an area that lacks access to affordable and fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy items. We chose to study their occurrence in three urban areas: Austin, Dallas, and Laredo, Texas. We further restricted our study to low-income areas where residents are less likely to have access to transportation and therefore are more negatively affected by supermarket distance than residents of wealthier areas.

## Conclusions

## Suggestions for Further Study

Are there correlations between the racial and ethnic makeup of a given neighborhood and its food desert status?

What are the relative health outcomes
