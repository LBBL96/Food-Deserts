# Food Deserts in Three Texas Cities

## Project Description

A food desert is an area that lacks access to affordable and fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy items. We chose to study their occurrence in three urban areas: Austin, Dallas, and Laredo, Texas. We further restricted our study to low-income areas where residents are less likely to have access to transportation and therefore are more negatively affected by supermarket distance than residents of wealthier areas.
