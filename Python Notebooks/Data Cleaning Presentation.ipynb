My rationale for taking this approach as opposed to going school-to-school and doing a nearby search was that I could quickly grab all grocery stores in the area and then use geopy to compare school coordinates to the grocery store coordinates to find the closest sets. This worked, but turned out not to be as simple as it looked. There was a lot of data cleaning required before I could run geopy.\n",
