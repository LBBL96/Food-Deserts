Stuff we should decide as a Team:
  1.Describe the core message or hypothesis for your project.
  2.Describe the questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them

Stuff that can be divided out between us:
  1. Data gathering-collecting all required data from multiple sources plus at least one API        
  2. Data cleaning-scrubbing the data of null values and errors                                                       
  3. Data exploration/analysis? - calculations from the clean data to start answering the questions                                                                                                                                           4.
  4. Data visualization-making the 6-8 graphs that will be used in the presentation
  5. Creating the presentation-synthesising the action statement, why we care ect......
